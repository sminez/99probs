[99 x Problems for x in langList]
---------------------------------

These are my solutions to the 99 prolog/LISP/Haskell...problem set in a variety
of languages. Along with the [Project Euler](https://github.com/sminez/Euler)
problems, I find that these are a nice set of quick problems to get to grips
with a new language before diving in more thoroughly. I'd made decent progress
in a variety of languages a while back but not keeping the solutions under git
combined with a hard-drive failure lost me what I had so far.

Lesson learned...let's try again!


### The Problem Sets

As per the [haskell.org wiki](https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems),
I'm splitting the problems into 11 sets (and as far as I can tell, there aren't
actually 99 problems...):
  - Questions 1 to 10: [Lists](https://wiki.haskell.org/99_questions/1_to_10)
  - Questions 11 to 20: [Lists, continued](https://wiki.haskell.org/99_questions/11_to_20)
  - Questions 21 to 28: [Lists again](https://wiki.haskell.org/99_questions/21_to_28)
  - Questions 31 to 41: [Arithmetic](https://wiki.haskell.org/99_questions/31_to_41)
  - Questions 46 to 50: [Logic and codes](https://wiki.haskell.org/99_questions/46_to_50)
  - Questions 54A to 60: [Binary trees](https://wiki.haskell.org/99_questions/54A_to_60)
  - Questions 61 to 69: [Binary trees, continued](https://wiki.haskell.org/99_questions/61_to_69)
  - Questions 70B to 73: [Multi-way trees](https://wiki.haskell.org/99_questions/70B_to_73)
  - Questions 80 to 89: [Graphs](https://wiki.haskell.org/99_questions/80_to_89)
  - Questions 90 to 94: [Miscellaneous problems](https://wiki.haskell.org/99_questions/90_to_94)
  - Questions 95 to 99: [Miscellaneous problems, continued](https://wiki.haskell.org/99_questions/95_to_99)
